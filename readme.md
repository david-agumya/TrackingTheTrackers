Tracking the trackers readme

## Tracking the Trackers project 
+ Idea : When you make a request to a website. The website can tracker you by including a pixel tracker. Downloading a pixel with a http request will result in the server capturing some information about the client making a request. 
+ We plan to make a chrome extension to track the trackers whereby we log infomation about tracker tracking user information.
